# crowdsourced-volunteering-list

An experiment to crowdsource a list of impactful yet agile volunteering projects.

**What is the repository about?** 

It presents a list of crowdsourced volunteering projects that don't charge any money (no voluntarism), are agile (no bureaucracy) yet give travellers the opportunity to have an impact.

**Why does this repository exist?** 

The repository aims to give travellers an overview of agile volunteering projects because I couldn't find any centralized source for these.

**For whom is this repository suitable?** 

Travellers who want to give something back and want to have an impact while travelling.
